# simple homepage

The code is intentionally kept to a minimum, so people can learn HTML and CSS ðŸŒ±

## few things to note
- No javascript.
- No remote fonts. The website loads the browsers default font.
- Please complain
- Send pull requests

## colors
Colorscheme can be changed in

```
:root {
  something something...
}
```
By default it uses https://github.com/sainnhe/everforest

## TODO
- [ ] detect if light or dark theme is set and adjust colors acordingly
- [ ] colorscheme selector (if possible with pure html/css)
